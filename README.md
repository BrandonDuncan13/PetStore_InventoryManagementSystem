# Adrian's Pet Store Inventory Management System
I'm passionate about C# and SQL development and wanted to learn how to connect a C# WinForms app to a SQL database. Inspired by the SQL Server Pet Store database project I made in NNU's databases course, which is included
in this project as PetStore.sql and has tables, CRUD, stored procedures, and more. This was also a great opportunity to refresh my SQL skills. Currently, the project isn't complete because it's connected to a 
temporary database and still needs to be modified to fit the Pet Store database so it's a work in progress. Followed a WinForms YouTube tutorial to make the app.

## Pet Store SQL Master File
Please see the PetStore.sql file to see all of the SQL code for the Pet Store database. 

## Login Form
Existing users can login to the Pet Store database.

## Main Form
Once logged in, users are taken to the main form with Products, Customers, Categories, Users, and Orders forms they can click on. Each form is populated with database information.

## Product Form
All of the different sections allow users to see information from the database, create a new record, update an existing record, and delete a record.

Nice and cool looking module to add a product to the SQL Server database.

See the Pet Store's customers and do stuff like add some new ones.

## Categories Form
Create new categories to organize the products. This will need to change to animal type and/or breed to fit with the actual Pet Store database.
